    <h2>Parking [IMPORTANT]</h2>
    <p>As with previous years we want to be respectful of the small residential neighborhood near our starting line. Nobody likes being woken up by slamming doors and loud voices at 6 in the morning when they don't have a reason to be awake. <strong>This year we're going to try and do a better job of making sure we don't disturb the neighborhood.</strong> To that end here are the RULES:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>NO PARKING in the Olomana Community (between Maunawili Elementary and the intersection of Kalanianaole Highway and Kailua Rd.)</li>
      <li>NO PARKING at Maunawili Elementary. This is Department of Education property, not public parking.</li>
      <li>Parking is available in the commercial area of downtown Kailua in the vicinity of Kalapawai Cafe & Deli.</li>
      <li>Wherever you park, <strong>be respectful</strong>. Don't slam your doors, don't talk loudly, and don't play loud music. Remember it is early in the morning, and not everybody has a 20k TT they're excited to get on with.</li>
      <li>Malama Aina. Leave any place you visit in better condition than you found it.</li>
    </ul>
