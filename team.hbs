    <p>
      At Outta Bounds we like to play bikes. That means we love to be in the saddle, on the road or
      in the mountains. We ride hard and work to be better cyclists, but first and foremost we have
      fun doing it. As a team we ride for each other, strive to give back to the community, and stay
      true to the spirit of Aloha.

      <li>

        <strong>What:</strong> We ride from Diamond Head out to Hanauma Bay, Sandy's Beach, or
        Makapu'u Point depending on the time of year and the weather. The ride is fast paced
        (18+ mph), but with a consistent route, regular regroup points, and a designated sweeper to
        ensure nobody gets left behind. On the way back we detour around Hawaii Kai, Nui Valley, and
        Hind Valley. We regroup at the Aloha Gas Station at Waialae and Kealaolu before heading back
        to Triangle Park for some post ride refreshments.

      Organizing bike races is a time-consuming and expensive endeavor, and we could use your
      support! If you're an individual we always need volunteers on race day. If you represent a
      business we could use sponsorships for individual races to help us cover expenses like road
      safety equipment, police escorts, and supplies for rider support. If you're interested in
      supporting the team or our races please email us at
      <a href="mailto:support@outtaboundshawaii.com">support@outtaboundshawaii.com</a>.
